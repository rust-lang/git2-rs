//! # libgit2 bindings for Rust
//!
//! This library contains bindings to the [libgit2][1] C library which is used
//! to manage git repositories. The library itself is a work in progress and is
//! likely lacking some bindings here and there, so be warned.
//!
//! [1]: https://libgit2.github.com/
//!
//! The git2-rs library strives to be as close to libgit2 as possible, but also
//! strives to make using libgit2 as safe as possible. All resource management
//! is automatic as well as adding strong types to all interfaces (including
//! `Result`)
//!
//! ## Creating a `Repository`
//!
//! The `Repository` is the source from which almost all other objects in git-rs
//! are spawned. A repository can be created through opening, initializing, or
//! cloning.
//!
//! ### Initializing a new repository
//!
//! The `init` method will create a new repository, assuming one does not
//! already exist.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #![allow(unstable)]
//! use git2::Repository;
//!
//! let repo = match Repository::init("/path/to/a/repo") {
//!     Ok(repo) => repo,
//!     Err(e) => panic!("failed to init: {}", e),
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! ### Opening an existing repository
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #![allow(unstable)]
//! use git2::Repository;
//!
//! let repo = match Repository::open("/path/to/a/repo") {
//!     Ok(repo) => repo,
//!     Err(e) => panic!("failed to open: {}", e),
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cloning an existing repository
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #![allow(unstable)]
//! use git2::Repository;
//!
//! let url = "https://github.com/alexcrichton/git2-rs";
//! let repo = match Repository::clone(url, "/path/to/a/repo") {
//!     Ok(repo) => repo,
//!     Err(e) => panic!("failed to clone: {}", e),
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! ## Working with a `Repository`
//!
//! All deriviative objects, references, etc are attached to the lifetime of the
//! source `Repository`, to ensure that they do not outlive the repository
//! itself.

    // Currently, libgit2 leverages OpenSSL for SSL support when cloning
    // repositories over HTTPS. This means that we're picking up an OpenSSL
    // dependency on non-Windows platforms (where it has its own HTTPS
    // subsystem). As a result, we need to link to OpenSSL.
    //
    // Now actually *linking* to OpenSSL isn't so hard. We just need to make
    // sure to use pkg-config to discover any relevant system dependencies for
    // differences between distributions like CentOS and Ubuntu. The actual
    // trickiness comes about when we start *distributing* the resulting
    // binaries. Currently Cargo is distributed in binary form as nightlies,
    // which means we're distributing a binary with OpenSSL linked in.
    //
    // For historical reasons, the Linux nightly builder is running a CentOS
    // distribution in order to have as much ABI compatibility with other
    // distributions as possible. Sadly, however, this compatibility does not
    // extend to OpenSSL. Currently OpenSSL has two major versions, 0.9 and 1.0,
    // which are incompatible (many ABI differences). The CentOS builder we
    // build on has version 1.0, as do most distributions today. Some still have
    // 0.9, however. This means that if we are to distribute the binaries built
    // by the CentOS machine, we would only be compatible with OpenSSL 1.0 and
    // we would fail to run (a dynamic linker error at runtime) on systems with
    // only 9.8 installed (hopefully).
    //
    // But wait, the plot thickens! Apparently CentOS has dubbed their OpenSSL
    // library as `libssl.so.10`, notably the `10` is included at the end. On
    // the other hand Ubuntu, for example, only distributes `libssl.so`. This
    // means that the binaries created at CentOS are hard-wired to probe for a
    // file called `libssl.so.10` at runtime (using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH), which
    // will not be found on ubuntu. The conclusion of this is that binaries
    // built on CentOS cannot be distributed to Ubuntu and run successfully.
    //
    // There are a number of sneaky things we could do, including, but not
    // limited to:
    //
    // 1. Create a shim program which runs "just before" cargo runs. The
    //    responsibility of this shim program would be to locate `libssl.so`,
    //    whatever it's called, on the current system, make sure there's a
    //    symlink *somewhere* called `libssl.so.10`, and then set up
    //    LD_LIBRARY_PATH and run the actual cargo.
    //
    //    This approach definitely seems unconventional, and is borderline
    //    overkill for this problem. It's also dubious if we can find a
    //    libssl.so reliably on the target system.
    //
    // 2. Somehow re-work the CentOS installation so that the linked-against
    //    library is called libssl.so instead of libssl.so.10
    //
    //    The problem with this approach is that systems with 0.9 installed will
    //    start to silently fail, due to also having libraries called libssl.so
    //    (probably symlinked under a more appropriate version).
    //
    // 3. Compile Cargo against both OpenSSL 1.0 *and* OpenSSL 0.9, and
    //    distribute both. Also make sure that the linked-against name of the
    //    library is `libssl.so`. At runtime we determine which version is
    //    installed, and we then the appropriate binary.
    //
    //    This approach clearly has drawbacks in terms of infrastructure and
    //    feasibility.
    //
    // 4. Build a nightly of Cargo for each distribution we'd like to support.
    //    You would then pick the appropriate Cargo nightly to install locally.
    //
    // So, with all this in mind, the decision was made to *statically* link
    // OpenSSL. This solves any problem of relying on a downstream OpenSSL
    // version being available. This does, however, open a can of worms related
    // to security issues. It's generally a good idea to dynamically link
    // OpenSSL as you'll get security updates over time without having to do
    // anything (the system administrator will update the local openssl
    // package). By statically linking, we're forfeiting this feature.
    //
    // The conclusion was made it is likely appropriate for the Cargo nightlies
    // to statically link OpenSSL, but highly encourage distributions and
    // packagers of Cargo to dynamically link OpenSSL. Packagers are targeting
    // one system and are distributing to only that system, so none of the
    // problems mentioned above would arise.
    //
    // In order to support this, a new package was made: openssl-static-sys.
    // This package currently performs a fairly simple task:
    //
    // 1. Run pkg-config to discover where openssl is installed.
    // 2. If openssl is installed in a nonstandard location, *and* static copies
    //    of the libraries are available, copy them to $OUT_DIR.
    //
    // This library will bring in libssl.a and libcrypto.a into the local build,
    // allowing them to be picked up by this crate. This allows us to configure
    // our own buildbots to have pkg-config point to these local pre-built
    // copies of a static OpenSSL (with very few dependencies) while allowing
    // most other builds of Cargo to naturally dynamically link OpenSSL.
    //
    // So in summary, if you're with me so far, we've statically linked OpenSSL
    // to the Cargo binary (or any binary, for that matter) and we're ready to
    // distribute it to *all* linux distributions. Remember that our original
    // intent for openssl was for HTTPS support, which implies that we need some
    // for of CA certificate store to validate certificates. This is normally
    // installed in a standard system location.
    //
    // Unfortunately, as one might imagine, OpenSSL is configured for where this
    // standard location is at *build time*, but it often varies widely
    // per-system. Consequently, it was discovered that OpenSSL will respect the
    // SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR environment variables in order to assist
    // in discovering the location of this file (hurray!).
    //
    // So, finally getting to the point, this function solely exists to support
    // our static builds of OpenSSL by probing for the "standard system
    // location" of certificates and setting relevant environment variable to
    // point to them.
    //
    // Ah, and as a final note, this is only a problem on Linux, not on OS X. On
    // OS X the OpenSSL binaries are stable enough that we can just rely on
    // dynamic linkage (plus they have some weird modifications to OpenSSL which
    // means we wouldn't want to link statically).
